    <h1>COVID-19 impact: How engineers are making a difference</h1>
    <big>
        <p>
            As a global community, we are experiencing unprecedented change on what seems like a daily basis. Here in the College of Engineering, we are committed to our educational and research mission. At the same time, many of us also have, as they say, dropped everything and devoted our expertise to help our state, country and world combat the COVID-19 pandemic. Here are some examples of this work.

        <h3>At UW-Madison, contactless thermometer helps monitor student health</h3>
        <p>
            Lennon Rodgers, director of the University of Wisconsin–Madison’s Grainger Engineering Design Innovation Laboratory, created a prototype “contactless” thermometer by borrowing the sensor from a commercially available thermometer and adding a microcontroller and distance sensor controlled by open-source code.
            <br><br>
            Now, devices based on that initial design are helping UW–Madison students monitor their COVID-19 symptoms. They’ve been deployed in residence halls on campus set aside for students isolating for at least 10 days after a positive COVID-19 diagnosis. Rodgers passed his initial idea to Nathan Strachen, a UW–Madison electrical and computer engineering graduate student and a Fab Fellow at the innovation lab. Strachen has made his own set of tweaks.

        <h3>Regaining balance: How women faculty can navigate expectations in a pandemic world</h3>
        <p>
            While the COVID-19 pandemic has disrupted academia as a whole, the crunch of balancing research, teaching and family responsibilities has fallen particularly hard on women faculty members. With that in mind, Biomedical Engineering Associate Professor Pamela Kreeger and frequent collaborator Kristyn Masters, a Vilas Distinguished Professor of biomedical engineering and H.I. Romnes Faculty Fellow at UW-Madison, have put together a list of 10 suggestions for women principal investigators to better navigate the juggling act of research, teaching, mentorship, service and at-home commitments during the pandemic. Their article, published in the journal PLOS Computational Biology and coauthored with seven other women faculty members from across the country, drew more than 5,000 views within 24 hours of publishing online, along with a steady stream of tweets.

        <h3>COVID-19 data model quantifies region-specific impact of social distancing orders</h3>
        <p>
            As the COVID-19 pandemic first took hold in regions across the United States in spring 2020, governors, mayors and local leaders hoping to quell the spread of the virus turned to the only actionable defenses available at the time: They closed schools and businesses, banned mass gatherings, issued stay-at-home orders and enforced other social distancing measures. Now, a study published Oct. 27, 2020, in the Annals of Internal Medicine by University of Wisconsin-Madison researchers quantifies the region-specific impact of social distancing measures on the COVID-19 caseload in three distinct areas: New York City, the Milwaukee metropolitan area and Dane County in Wisconsin.

            Oguzhan Alagoz, Proctor and Gamble-Bascom Professor of industrial and systems engineering in the College of Engineering, and Nasia Safdar, professor of medicine in the School of Medicine and Public Health and UW Health medical director of infection control, led the research team. The group also included School of Medicine and Public Health researchers Ajay Sethi, professor of population health sciences; Brian Patterson, assistant professor of emergency medicine; and Matthew Churpek, associate professor of medicine.

        <h3>More poll workers and no arenas: Operations researchers offer guidelines for resilient voting systems</h3>
        <p>
            As cities and other municipalities prepare for a 2020 presidential election that will be unlike any before it, set against the backdrop of a pandemic, they face dilemmas in how to structure and staff their in-person polling places: How can they best protect voters and poll workers from COVID-19? How do they minimize wait times? What if there are shortages of poll workers? Should they consolidate polling locations or turn to sports arenas as voting sites? Laura Albert, a professor of industrial and systems engineering at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, and PhD student Adam Schmidt have analyzed some of the options in a report they’ve shared with the Wisconsin Elections Commission ahead of the Nov. 3 election.
