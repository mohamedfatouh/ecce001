        <h3>Fitter increases the benefits of wearing a mask during the COVID-19 pandemic</h3>
        <p>
            Whether homemade or commercially manufactured, breathable cloth and disposable face masks fit everybody differently, leaving gaps at the top, sides, bottom—or any combination thereof—that could allow virus particles to escape. Now, a team of University of Wisconsin–Madison engineers has developed a simple and inexpensive do-it-yourself fitter that ensures a tighter mask seal around the wearer’s nose, mouth and face.
            <br><br>
            Known as the Badger Seal, the mask fitter is a soft, adjustable “frame” with elastic worn either as ear loops or behind the head. With readily available materials, such as elastic cord, foam wire or pipe cleaners, the fitter is easy to make at home in minutes. When worn over non-medical-grade disposable masks, the Badger Seal significantly improves the masks’ filtration performance, according to research conducted by Scott Sanders and David Rothamer, UW–Madison professors of mechanical engineering and experts in measuring gases and particles in internal combustion engine processes.

        <h3>Everybody poops, some shed the virus that causes COVID-19. Wisconsin’s wastewater surveillance is looking for it.</h3>
        <p>
            It’s like searching for a needle in a haystack. Except the haystack is human excrement. The needle, a tiny fragment of the tiny genetic material of a tiny virus that has, since December 2019, had a massive impact on the world. Scientists at the Wisconsin State Laboratory of Hygiene, with collaborators at the University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee School of Freshwater Sciences, are sifting through raw sewage collected once or twice per week from nearly 100 wastewater treatment facilities statewide, and at the University of Wisconsin–Madison, in search of the genetic fingerprint of the virus that causes COVID-19, SARS-CoV-2. Detecting and measuring how much virus there is may provide an early warning signal that cases of COVID-19 may soon rise and provide a readout of how levels of virus change in a population over time. It could give hospitals time to prepare for an increase in patients.
            <br><br>
            At UW–Madison, wastewater surveillance also provides an opportunity to target campus testing (UW–Madison is offering no-cost testing for all students and employees), isolation and quarantine, and limit disease spread. This is especially important since the virus can transmit from person-to-person before symptoms begin, and some people with the virus never develop symptoms at all. “We picked this up in late March and said this is really something we should be doing,” says Martin Shafer, a scientist at the WSLH and the UW–Madison College of Engineering. “We put a proposal into the (Wisconsin) Department of Health Services, and it was funded … It’s the largest in terms of the number of wastewater facilities in the country.”

        <h3>A research-based guide to choosing the right mask for you</h3>
        <p>
            For many Americans, face coverings have become a way of life amid the COVID-19 pandemic. And whether citizens are wearing a mask to comply with an order, trying to stay healthy, working to keep the community healthy—or all of the above—there’s a mask option that works with people’s preferences, lifestyle and goals, says Scott Sanders, a professor of mechanical engineering at the University of Wisconsin-Madison.
            <br><br>
            A researcher who uses optical techniques to study and measure particulates in internal-combustion engine processes, Sanders more recently has applied his expertise to studying the efficacy of non-medical-grade mask alternatives. In his latest tests, Sanders used a mannequin not wearing a mask to show how particles from a human breath and droplets from a sneeze spray forward. Then, he studied how adding various face coverings—including a face shield, a homemade four-layer tightly knit mask, and a disposable non-medical-grade filtering mask—to the mannequin trapped or released those particles and droplets.

        <h3>UW experts design masks for campus from scratch</h3>
        <p>
            Students and staff returning to the University of Wisconsin–Madison can protect each other from COVID-19 with masks designed by the university’s experts in textiles, filtration and infectious disease, and made by one of Wisconsin’s oldest companies. By the time the fall semester begins, as many as 24,000 of the new face coverings will be available to help people comply with the campus requirement to wear masks in buildings and other situations in which distancing isn’t possible. Each one is the product of an exhaustive — and exhausting — process that wrestled with a feverish, worldwide rush on fabric inventories and ultimately churned through testing of 130 different combinations of materials to field a mask that textile chemist Majid Sarmadi calls “best in class.” David Rothamer, Robert Lorenz Professor of Mechanical Engineering, played a crucial role on the project: He reworked his combustion engine laboratory to measure the filtering properties of prototype masks.
