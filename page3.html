        <h3>Boutilier collaborating on data-driven COVID-19 surveillance system</h3>
        <p>
            Justin Boutilier, an assistant professor of industrial and systems engineering, is lending his expertise in predictive analytics and machine learning to a new effort to develop an advanced surveillance system to identify future waves of COVID-19 and responsive training for frontline healthcare workers in Wisconsin. The project, funded through a COVID-19 Response Grant from the Wisconsin Partnership Program at the UW School of Medicine and Public Health (SMPH), is a collaboration between the BerbeeWalsh Department of Emergency Medicine in the SMPH, UW Health and the Marshfield Clinic Research Institute.

        <h3>Simpler COVID-19 test could provide results in hours from saliva</h3>
        <p>
            Volunteers at four sites in Madison are being tested for the virus that causes COVID-19 by spitting in a vial, which may prove faster, cheaper and less complicated than other common tests, according to University of Wisconsin–Madison researchers.
            <br><br>
            Scientists from UW–Madison’s AIDS Vaccine Research Laboratory have tuned a relatively simple genetic testing process to find evidence of the novel coronavirus in saliva. David Beebe, a professor of pathology and biomedical engineering at UW-Madison who has experience in putting lab tests on small, reproducible chips, is collaborating on the project. In addition, Salus, the Madison-based spinoff company Beebe helped create in 2013, has joined the effort. The company is working on a commercial version of the test that can be deployed in small, mobile labs that could be straightforward enough to be operated by people without lengthy lab science training.

        <h3>Grad student helping organize PPE production, COVID response in developing countries</h3>
        <p>
            Rebecca Alcock, a recent master’s degree recipient in biomedical engineering and an incoming PhD student in industrial and systems engineering at UW-Madison, is leading a large-scale, United Nations-backed effort to mobilize production of personal protective equipment (PPE) and more in Guatemala and other developing countries around the world amid the COVID-19 pandemic. The project is a collaboration among engineers and other experts at UW-Madison, Marquette University, the University of Colorado Anschutz Medical Campus, Colorado Mesa University, Engineers Without Borders (EWB) and the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP).

        <h3>New shield couples COVID-19 protection with a clear view of the face</h3>
        <p>
            University of Wisconsin-Madison engineers worked with partners from UW Health, Midwest Prototyping and others to create the Badger Shield+, a face shield that provides a full, clear view of the face while still filtering virus particles through surgical fabric that cinches around the wearer’s chin and jawline. Just days after its public “launch” in mid-July, the Badger Shield+ has generated requests from more than 300 organizations from 44 states. Midwest Prototyping is fulfilling orders for the Badger Shield+; however, as is the case for its predecessor, Rodgers says the team plans to make the new version available to manufacturers as open-source design drawings, also.
            <br><br>
            At the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic in the United States, the team’s focus was on ensuring healthcare professionals in particular had enough personal protective equipment. This time, with the Badger Shield+, engineer Lennon Rodgers, director of the Grainger Engineering Design Innovation Laboratory, or engineering makerspace, at UW-Madison, and colleague Karl Williamson developed a design that not only met the UW Health requirements, but they also sought to broaden its reach.
            <br><br>
            “Karl and I started working on this two months ago when we saw this wave of public openings,” says Rodgers. “We were starting to think outside the box for PPE that didn’t exist. Most PPE is designed for hospitals; we wanted PPE that members of the public could use as they went about their lives. It’s well suited for schools, and for people who need others to see their mouth or need an alternative PPE solution for various reasons.”
