        <h3>Coughing visualization illustrates the benefits of wearing a good mask</h3>
        <p>
            UW–Madison Mechanical Engineering Professor Scott Sanders’ team made a video that demonstrates how droplets from a single cough escape from or remain inside of varying mask styles and materials. While the visualization doesn’t directly track the spread of virus particles, Sanders believes it will help people see a risk that is otherwise invisible.
            <br><br>
            In his tests, Sanders found that in general, the homemade mask shape most effective at containing droplets is a neck-gaiter-style mask that combines a nose piece with an elastic cord that wearers can toggle to snug the mask to their face. He also has created a video that shows a simple way to sew the neck-gaiter mask using a rectangle of tightly woven fabric, a toggle, cord and metal nose piece.

        <h3>Model response: Alum helps launch COVID data hub</h3>
        <p>
            James Tamplin (BSIE ’06, MSIE ’07) worked with a handful of fellow veterans of the Silicon Valley tech scene to develop CovidActNow.org, a website that tracks, among other data points, each state’s infection rate. The site, which bills itself as “America’s COVID warning system,” drew roughly 8 million visitors in the first week after its March 20 launch.
            <br><br>
            Early on, the Covid Act Now team created projections for disease spread under several policy approaches, ranging from no restrictions to a full lockdown. States such as Michigan and Kentucky cited the group’s model in announcing their respective stay-at-home orders. “We showed people pretty clearly—which wasn’t being done in late March—what each of these scenarios would mean to the hospital capacity in the local area, and I think it really hit home,” Tamplin says.

        <h3>Engineering projects selected for UW/WARF COVID-19 Accelerator Challenge</h3>
        <p>
            The Wisconsin Alumni Research Foundation has selected four innovative projects led by College of Engineering faculty for development funding through the UW/WARF COVID-19 Accelerator Challenge. Each is designed to be rapidly advanced over the coming months to help combat the pandemic. The grants, says Steve Ackerman, UW-Madison vice chancellor for research and graduate education, “are critical to helping our research community more quickly advance commercially promising technologies closer to the marketplace in response to COVID-19 impacts. It’s partnerships such as this one with WARF that allow us to tackle the immediate and ongoing challenges that this pandemic presents. We are grateful to WARF for offering this opportunity to UW-Madison and Morgridge Institute for Research researchers, from faculty to staff and students.”

        <h3>Wisconsin’s COVID-19 stay at home order drove changes in state’s traffic volume</h3>
        <p>
            Traffic along Wisconsin’s highways had an unprecedented drop and remained well below normal in the weeks since Gov. Tony Evers’ Safer at Home order took effect March 25, 2020. The findings are the result of an ongoing traffic study at the University of Wisconsin-Madison’s Traffic Operations and Safety (TOPS) Laboratory in partnership with the Wisconsin Department of Transportation. Interstate traffic volumes began to decline in the week leading up to the World Health Organization declaration of COVID-19 as a global pandemic on March 12, 2020, and a U.S. federal emergency declaration the next day.
            <br><br>
            The pandemic’s unprecedented circumstances afforded David Noyce, a professor of civil and environmental engineering and director of the TOPS Lab, and researcher Jon Riehl an opportunity to study real-world traffic pattern shifts that are typically only theoretical. Observing real-world performance with reduced volumes on traditionally busy highways can allow engineers to better understand traffic flow compared to predictive computer models, and then pinpoint jam points on highways. “With the reduced traffic volumes, we can now more precisely understand different highway segments’ performance characteristics and compare this to the theoretical values used during highway planning and construction,” Riehl says. “Traffic data like this provides the opportunity to tune the empirical equations we use in highway design and to improve our performance models—which ultimately leads to improvement in highway design and traffic engineering.”

        <h3>Badger Talks video: A look at reopening after lockdown</h3>
        <p>
            Risk analyst Vicki Bier, a professor of industrial and systems engineering, shares insight about the decision-making process that goes into how to reopen a community after quarantine. There may be an inclination to hurry, with so many people eager for their lives to return to normal, but there are good reasons for moving slowly, Bier says.
